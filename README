jmx4py - A Python Client for the Jolokia JMX Agent
==================================================

Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160 connectors. 
It is an agent based approach with support for many platforms. In addition 
to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX remoting with unique features like 
bulk requests or fine grained security policies. 

jmx4py offers a client API similar to the existing Jolokia clients for Perl 
(jmx4perl), Java and Javascript. Additionally, it'll build upon the basic
API and offer further features related to monitoring and controlling JVMs
via JMX using Python.


SETUP

To create a working directory, follow these steps on a POSIX system:

    git clone git://github.com/jhermann/jmx4py.git
    cd jmx4py
    ./bootstrap.py
    . ./bin/activate
    
Note that an already activated Python virtualenv is used for the project, 
otherwise a new one is created locally. In either case necessary tools are 
then installed into the chosen virtualenv. See the bootstrap script for 
details.

A similar procedure should work on Windows, but is not yet tested (reports welcome):

    git clone git://github.com/jhermann/jmx4py.git
    cd jmx4py
    python bootstrap.py
