"""
    JMX for Python – A Python Client for the Jolokia JMX Agent.

    Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160 connectors.
    It is an agent based approach with support for many platforms. In addition
    to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX remoting with unique features like
    bulk requests or fine grained security policies.

    jmx4py offers a client API similar to the existing Jolokia clients for Perl
    (jmx4perl), Java and Javascript. Additionally, it'll build upon the basic
    API and offer further features related to monitoring and controlling JVMs
    via JMX using Python.
